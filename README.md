# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
To visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Resources
GeoJSON from USGS, JavaScript, D3.js, Leaflet, Mapbox

## Project Summary
I used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days, then added the data to a map. Pulled from the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Then, I used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data.
